            <h2>Our Technology</h2>
            <p>Our diabetes prediction model is built using advanced machine learning algorithms. Here's a brief overview of our process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We gather data from reliable sources to train our prediction model. The dataset includes various health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Our data scientists clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and selecting the most relevant variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to train our prediction model. This involves dividing the data into training and testing sets, and fine-tuning the model for optimal performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction and Accuracy:</strong> Our model provides predictions on the likelihood of diabetes based on the input data. We continually evaluate and improve the model to ensure high accuracy and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Our platform is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use. Simply input your health metrics, and our model will provide you with a prediction and actionable insights.</li>
